Glossary

Container
^^^^^^^^^

A Docker image, when itâ€™s run in a host computer, spawns a process with
its own namespace, known as a Docker container. A Docker container has a
thin read/write layer known as the container layer.
Any changes to the filesystem of a
container, such as writing new files or modifying existing files, are done to
this writable container layer rather than the lower layers.

Image
^^^^^

Docker image is a read-only template that forms the foundation of your
application.
Docker images are created using a series of commands, known as
instructions, in the `Dockerfile`.

Layer
^^^^^

A layer is a modification applied to a Docker image as represented by an
instruction in a Dockerfile. Typically, a layer is created when a base image
is changed.
